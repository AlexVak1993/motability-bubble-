          <h3>Q2</h3>
          <p>When it comes to Motability 4x4 <strong>capability</strong> the Audi Q2, the Q range’s smallest SUV, is
            quite <b>particular</b>. Only the <strong>most powerful automatic engines</strong> offer the famed
            <strong>Audi quattro</strong>
            <b>all-wheel-drive</b>. However, with a
            choice of <b>4 different trim levels</b> and a <b>range of colours</b>, the options are anything but
            limited.
          </p>
          <p> Manual <b>seat height adjustment</b> is standard on all models and <b>lumbar support</b> is an optional extra. As with
            all compact SUVs, what you <b>gain in handling and parkability</b>, you’ll sacrifice in the interior space, meaning
            that the rear seats could feel snug for 3 and the small door width makes access a little tight.
            Nevertheless, <b>a boot capacity of 405 litres</b>, and more than twice that with the rear seats down, is still good.

          <p><b>Huge front seats</b> and one of the <b>best suspensions</b> in its class allow for <strong>exceptional comfort</strong> in the Citroën
            C5 Aircross. With its <b>quirky looks</b>, including Airbump door and wheel arch protectors, this Motability 4x4
            proves that <b>practical doesn’t have to be boring.</b> The large front space does mean that rear legroom is a tad
            limited but the <b>sliding and reclining back seats</b>, and a <b>580 litre boot space</b> (even more with the rear seats
            down) go some way to compensate.
          </p>
          <p>Keyless entry, park assist and electric parking brake all <b>make driving easier</b>, especially if your mobility
            is limited. An <b>8'' touchscreen</b> allows users to control temperature, multimedia, navigation and phone
            (including wireless charging), <b>all from one place</b>.

          <h3>Renegade</h3>
          <p>While it might not look like your typical Motability 4x4, the <strong>boxy shape</strong> of the Jeep Renegade actually
            makes it <b>very practical indeed</b>. Doors open to a very accommodating 70 degrees (front) or 80 degrees (rear),
            and with the back seats folded can provide a cavernous <b>1,297 litres</b> of luggage, wheelchair or equipment
            space.
          </p>
          <p> Cruise control, lane departure warning and traffic sign recognition allow you to <b>relax a little</b> while in
            charge of the wheel while the <b>hard-wearing mesh fabric</b> of the seats are a match for any transfer plate. <b>5
              different drive modes</b>, including ‘snow’ and ‘mud’, and a 9-speed automatic transmission mean that <b>you can
                get pretty much anywhere</b>.
