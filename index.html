        <p class="presentation__description">If you have limited mobility, there’s no reason why you shouldn’t have
          access to a practical, easy-to-drive
          car that looks good too. 4x4 SUVs have become very popular on the Motability Scheme thanks to the many
          features that make them stylish accessories and excellent road companions for everyone, not just those who
          need a little help to get out and about.</p>

        <div class="presentation__column">
          <p>Many Motability 4x4s have a higher driving position which allows better visibility and easy access.
            Spacious luggage capacity is ideal for transporting wheelchairs and walking aids while easy handling can be
            had thanks to their compact size and 4x4 properties.</p>
          <p>The Motability Scheme makes car ownership ever so easy with the inclusion of relevant adaptations, annual
            Road Tax, breakdown cover, some servicing, maintenance and repairs at no extra cost. Let’s take a look at
            some of the most popular Motability 4x4s currently available on the scheme. Choose any one of these and you
            could be enjoying a more comfortable and accessible drive in no time...</p>

          <h2>Audi</h2>
          <h3>Q2</h3>
          <p>When it comes to Motability 4x4 capability the Audi Q2, the Q range’s smallest SUV, is quite particular.
            Only
            the most powerful automatic engines offer the famed Audi quattro all-wheel-drive. However, with a choice of
            4
            different trim levels and a range of colours, the options are anything but limited.
          </p>
          <p> Manual seat height adjustment is standard on all models and lumbar support is an optional extra. As with
            all
            compact SUVs, what you gain in handling and parkability, you’ll sacrifice in the interior space, meaning
            that
            the rear seats could feel snug for 3 and the small door width makes access a little tight. Nevertheless, a
            boot capacity of 405 litres, and more than twice that with the rear seats down, is still good.

          <h3>C5 Aircross</h3>
          <p>Huge front seats and one of the best suspensions in its class allow for exceptional comfort in the Citroën
            C5 Aircross. With its quirky looks, including Airbump door and wheel arch protectors, this Motability 4x4
            proves that practical doesn’t have to be boring. The large front space does mean that rear legroom is a tad
            limited but the sliding and reclining back seats, and a 580 litre boot space (even more with the rear seats
            down) go some way to compensate.
          </p>
          <p>Keyless entry, park assist and electric parking brake all make driving easier, especially if your mobility
            is limited. An 8'' touchscreen allows users to control temperature, multimedia, navigation and phone
            (including wireless charging), all from one place.

            silhouette, tilt and slide panoramic sunroof, tinted rear windows and up to 18-inch alloy wheels. The
            luxurious interior offers an ergonomic layout and flexible seating with sophisticated design features, such

          <p> A multifunction steering wheel and 8-inch colour touchscreen put everything at your fingertips while a
            level boot area with variable floor height and load through facility makes loading and unloading as easy on
            your back as the VW TIguan is on the eye. 4MOTION Active Control provides four different driving modes - On
            road, Off-road, Off-road Individual and Snow - to suit every condition.

          <h3>Renegade</h3>
          <p>While it might not look like your typical Motability 4x4, the boxy shape of the Jeep Renegade actually
            makes it very practical indeed. Doors open to a very accommodating 70 degrees (front) or 80 degrees (rear),
            and with the back seats folded can provide a cavernous 1,297 litres of luggage, wheelchair or equipment
            space.
          </p>
          <p> Cruise control, lane departure warning and traffic sign recognition allow you to relax a little while in
            charge of the wheel while the hard-wearing mesh fabric of the seats are a match for any transfer plate. 5
            different drive modes, including ‘snow’ and ‘mud’, and a 9-speed automatic transmission mean that you can
            get pretty much anywhere.
