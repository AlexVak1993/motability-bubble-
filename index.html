        <p class="presentation__description">If you have limited mobility, there’s no reason why you shouldn’t have
          access to a practical, easy-to-drive
          car that looks good too. 4x4 SUVs have become very popular on the Motability Scheme thanks to the many
          features that make them stylish accessories and excellent road companions for everyone, not just those who
          need a little help to get out and about.</p>

        <div class="presentation__column">
          <p>Many Motability 4x4s have a higher driving position which allows better visibility and easy access.
            Spacious luggage capacity is ideal for transporting wheelchairs and walking aids while easy handling can be
            had thanks to their compact size and 4x4 properties.</p>
          <p>The Motability Scheme makes car ownership ever so easy with the inclusion of relevant adaptations, annual
            Road Tax, breakdown cover, some servicing, maintenance and repairs at no extra cost. Let’s take a look at
            some of the most popular Motability 4x4s currently available on the scheme. Choose any one of these and you
            could be enjoying a more comfortable and accessible drive in no time...</p>

          <p>When it comes to Motability 4x4 capability the Audi Q2, the Q range’s smallest SUV, is quite particular. Only
            the most powerful automatic engines offer the famed Audi quattro all-wheel-drive. However, with a choice of 4
            different trim levels and a range of colours, the options are anything but limited.
          </p>
          <p> Manual seat height adjustment is standard on all models and lumbar support is an optional extra. As with all
            compact SUVs, what you gain in handling and parkability, you’ll sacrifice in the interior space, meaning that
            the rear seats could feel snug for 3 and the small door width makes access a little tight. Nevertheless, a
            boot capacity of 405 litres, and more than twice that with the rear seats down, is still good.
